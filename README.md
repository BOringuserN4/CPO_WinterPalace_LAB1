# CPO_WinterPalace_LAB1

## Description

Lab 1: Mutable Algorithms and Data Structure Implementation

Objectives:

* Use development tools:
    Python 3, IDE/source code editor, git, Github Actions, and laboratory work process.
* Design algorithms and data structures in mutable styles.
* Develop unit and property-based tests.

Variant 3:

Set based on binary-tree

* You need to check that you implementation corectly works with None value.

## Analysis and Conclusion

In this Lab, we implement the Binary Tree's mutable algorithms and
data structure Implementation.
The running result screenshot of unittests is the image named `image/img.png`. 
We write two python files,  `mutable.py` and `mutable_test.py`,
and successfully implement some operations about binary-tree, for example,
add and remove element,  concat  the trees to the new tree, etc.
The unittest and PBT tests provides us with great convenience.
